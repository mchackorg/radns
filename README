Router Advertisement DNS (radns)

This is a small program used for getting hold of one or more addresses
of resolving DNS servers. It listens for IPv6 Router Advertisements
with the Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) option and stores it in a file
in the same syntax as resolv.conf(5). Currently, the default file name
is ./resolv.conf. Settable with -f <filename>.

Start like this as root:

  # ./radns

Logs will be sent through syslog to the LOG_DAEMON facility.

If you want radns to run in foreground and log to the terminal, add -v
for "verbosity". For even more verbosity, including hex dumps of the
received messages, repeat it, such as -v -v -v.

radns can be used with Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) with the use
of additional software, such as DoCoMo Labs' userland SEND
implementation:

For radns to be useful, there must be a corresponding program on the
router, sending out Router Advertisements with the RDNSS option. One
such program is radvd:
