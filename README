Router Advertisement DNS (radns)

radns listens for IPv6 Router Advertisements with the Recursive DNS
Server (RDNSS) and the DNS Search List (DNSSL) options and stores the
search list and address(es) in a file in the same syntax as
resolv.conf(5). The default filename is ./resolv.conf, but it is
configurable with -f <filename>.

== Building, Configuration & Integration ==

To build you will need to know if Posix realtime function
clock_gettime() needs a special library. On Linux systems, for
instance, this is in librt (link with -lrt). Obviously, you will need
the socket API. On some systems this is in libsocket (link with
-lsocket).

If your system use the resolvconf programs to configure resolv.conf
and you intend to use the -c flag in radns to use a priveleged helper
program to call resolvconf, you need to know the path to the
resolvconf binary. Add it to the define in the Makefile:

  -DRESOLVCONF=\"/usr/local/sbin/resolvconf\"

Configuration and integration is a bit system dependent. Look at the
file named after your system in this directory. For FreeBSD, read
README.FreeBSD, et cetera.

== Logs ==

Logs will be sent through syslog to the LOG_DAEMON facility. If you
want radns to run in the foreground and log to the terminal instead,
add -v for "verbosity". For even more verbosity, including hex dumps
of the received messages, repeat it, up to -v -v -v.

== Development ==

The latest version can usually be found here:

  http://hack.org/mc/hacks/radns/

There is a git repository here:

  git://hack.org/radns

If you think the early history looks funny, it's because the releases
(not every commit --- just the releases) were exported from Perforce
and imported to CVS by hand. Not much development was done in CVS and
then everything was migrated to git.
 
== Texts ==

Some references:

RFC 2460 Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) 
RFC 3971 SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
RFC 3972 Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA)
RFC 4861 Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6).
RFC 5006 IPv6 Router Advertisement Option for DNS Configuration (obsolete)
RFC 6106 IPv6 Router Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration

radns might be usable with SEND but it's untested.

== Authors ==

radns was originally written by Michael Cardell Widerkrantz (MC) in
2008 for Stickybit AB and has since been maintained by MC.
