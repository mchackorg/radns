- Update to support RFC 6106, including DNS Search List.

- A TTL of all 1s is infinity 0xffffffff. Don't remove. Ever, even in
  2038.

- If TTL == 0, remove! Already in RFC 5006.

- If we only updated expire time, don't write to disk.

- Ignore SIGCHILD instead of wait()? How portable?

- When writing resolv.conf, write to temporary file and rename to make
  it atomic?

- Use logmsg() everywhere. Eliminate printf().

- use umask(0)

- Patch RDNSS option into FreeBSD's rtadvd. Maybe done in OpenBSD.
  Port?
