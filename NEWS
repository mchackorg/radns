  * I discovered that we wrote to the file even if the address had
    expired and contained garbage. Fixed.

2010-12-27

  * Embarassing bug appeared when adding aging of information. The
    resolv.conf would be written to even if we didn't get any RDNSS
    option! Now fixed.

  * Even more embarassing: mkpidfile() was called before daemon()! Now
    fixed.

  * Changed rc.d script. Can now start at boot.

2010-05-28

  * Added man page.

2010-04-30

  * Creates pid file.
  
  * Includes rc.d start script for FreeBSD.

  * Handles time to live.

  * Sorts resolvers by arrival time.

  * Updates identical resolvers by upping ttl.

  * Calls script when new updates arrive. Example script provided in
    radns-script.

  * Example script for cooperation with ISC's DHCP client dhclient
    included, see dhclient-exit-hooks.

  * Drops privileges early to designated user.

  * Now knows which network interface the update arrived. This
    information is passed to the external script. Necessary for the
    resolvconf program.

  * Added copyright information.

  * Fixed bug when several resolvers are present.

0.8 - 2008-09-29

  Only change is to add "STICKYBIT AB" to a few places in LICENSE and
